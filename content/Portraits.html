            I do private portrait commissions too. I’ve worked with some wonderful families over the years to capture
            their characters and recreate them in my own style.

        Every portrait I undertake is crafted in a way that is completely unique to the client. I find out all about
        the subjects, their characters, likes and dislikes. We discuss settings and interactions. Favourite clothes,
        books, animals, you name it.

        Prices start at £50 for a single character portrait with a simple colour background. Additional characters are
        charged at £15 each. Portraits are beautiful giclee prints on archival paper. An A4 print costs around £10
        including postage and packaging. I’d be more than happy to discuss your individual needs. Do you want your
        portrait to be set on a beach or in a garden? Do you want a large print? No problem at all. Talk to me and I’d
        be happy to give you a quote.
