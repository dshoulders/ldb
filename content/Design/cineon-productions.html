            Cineon Productions, specialists in the creation of immersive extended reality content, had a successful
            brand with a look and feel they were happy with for several years but they felt everything needed a bit of a
            refresh as the company was diversifying and expanding.

        I was asked to create something that utilised their current colour palette and was given a brief that welcomed
        creativity and a modern look whilst retaining the company’s trusted core values.
    </p>
    <p class="padding-left padding-right">
        Cineon wanted a new logo, brand guidelines, designs for merchandise, business cards and promotional materials. I
        expanded their colour palette with additional complimentary colours to allow more variety within the identity.
        The new logo was modern, brilliantly simple, scalable and gave a nod towards the company’s roots within film and
        vision.

    </div>
    <p class="padding-left padding-right">
        Once the new guidelines were in place, this set the foundation to create a range of printed materials and went
        on to shape a new look website.
