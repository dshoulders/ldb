            Sylvawood Seeds wanted a product with a look that would stand out from the rest, proudly reflect their eco ethos and look great on the shelf of any garden centre or gift shop.

        Together, using market research, mood boards and concept development we created a brand that ticked all the boxes and was tailored to suit their target audience. We sourced a print company that could not only deliver the quality of the product that was required but also had the ‘green’ approach that would match the brand. 
    </p>
    <p class="padding-left padding-right">
        The project deliverables included brand development, bespoke product packaging, marketing materials and point of sale design. The brand was also future proofed by creating it in such a way that design for further products could easily be produced.
