# About Me

Hello. I’m Lucy, an illustrator and graphic designer based on the beautiful south coast of Devon. With over 6 years professional experience I’ve produced a wide range of artwork for a variety of print, web, film and exhibition projects, working with a diverse spectrum of clients.

I bring a sense of fun and style to everything I do and have a passion for creating entirely original, bespoke pieces of work. Being both an illustrator and graphic designer I am able to produce complete artworks that are needed for a project. If you are looking for someone to work with you to produce an illustrated infographic or marketing material containing original character work, then yep, I’m your gal.
