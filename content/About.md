# Who I am

My name is Lucy and I’m a freelance graphic designer and illustrator. With over 8
years professional experience I’ve produced a wide range of artwork for a variety of
print, web, film and exhibition projects, working with a diverse spectrum of clients.
I love what I do.

My experience covers design for marketing materials, corporate identity (including
branding and logo design), reports, web/UI design, as well as editorial, commercial
and private commissions for illustration.
