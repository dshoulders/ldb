            Who I am
        </h1>
        <p>
            My name is Lucy and I’m a freelance graphic designer and illustrator. With over 8
            years professional experience I’ve produced a wide range of artwork for a variety of
            print, web, film and exhibition projects, working with a diverse spectrum of clients.
            I love what I do.
        </p>
        <p>
            My expertise covers marketing materials, corporate identity (including branding and logo design), report
            creation, web/UI design, as well as editorial, commercial and private commissions for illustration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being both an illustrator and graphic designer I am able to produce complete artworks that are needed for a
            project. If you are looking for someone to work with you to produce an illustrated infographic or marketing
            material containing original character work then look no further.

        </h1>
        <p>
            I’m a creative with a strong belief in process. Here’s what to expect when you work with me.

                    This is where our journey begins. Talk to me and tell me everything I need to know... and more. I
                    love to hear about your brand, event, resource, whatever it may be. If you have ideas then great, but
                    if not we can start to get the creativity flowing.

                    proven impact? What are the trends and
                    how would your project look to a future
