            The self titled Velvet & Stone album is the third piece Iâ€™ve worked on with the Devon based indie-folk band.
            They had worked with a photographer and chosen an image for their front cover but wanted an illustrated
            insert that would compliment their style, the music and the beautiful photograph.

    <p class="padding-left padding-right">
        We discussed possibilities and landed upon the notion of a journey. I wanted to capture a sense of the ethereal
        to create the perfect relationship between the music and the art.

            <p class="margin-top-lge">
                Each illustration takes the viewer on a voyage to the unknown through landscapes loved by the band
                members,
                finally leading you down to the shore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the illustrations were complete I compiled the whole insert, capturing their lyrics, and went on to
                finalise the album artwork in its entirety.
