        <p>
            My name is Lucy and I’m a freelance graphic designer and illustrator. With over 8
            years professional experience I’ve produced a wide range of artwork for a variety of
            print, web, film and exhibition projects, working with a diverse spectrum of clients.
            I love what I do.
        </p>

            My experience covers design for marketing materials, corporate identity (including
            branding and logo design), reports, web/UI design, as well as editorial, commercial
            and private commissions for illustration.
